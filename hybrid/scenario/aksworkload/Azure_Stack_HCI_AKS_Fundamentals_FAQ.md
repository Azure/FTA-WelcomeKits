Welcome to the "Azure Stack HCI – AKS Fundamentals FAQ Welcome Kit." This comprehensive guide is designed to provide you with essential insights into the foundational aspects of Kubernetes, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Resource Bridge, Azure Arc, and the unique integration of AKS with Azure Stack HCI. 

## Fundamentals (Kubernetes, AKS, Azure Stack HCI AKS)
### What are the differences between Kubernetes and AKS?
- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that can be run on any infrastructure, while AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) is a fully managed Kubernetes service provided by Microsoft that runs in the Azure cloud.
- Kubernetes requires manual setup and configuration, while AKS automates much of the setup and management of Kubernetes clusters.
- AKS provides integrated support for Azure services such as Azure Active Directory, Azure Monitor, and Azure Policy, while Kubernetes requires additional configuration to integrate with these services.
- AKS provides built-in security features such as network isolation, role-based access control, and private container registry, while Kubernetes requires additional configuration to implement these features.
- AKS provides automatic scaling of the Kubernetes cluster based on workload demands, while Kubernetes requires manual scaling.
- AKS provides a simplified billing model compared to running Kubernetes on your own infrastructure, as you only pay for the resources used by the AKS cluster.

### What are the differences between AKS and Azure Stack HCI AKS?
- AKS is a fully managed Kubernetes service provided by Microsoft that runs in the Azure cloud, while Azure Stack HCI AKS is a Kubernetes service that runs on-premises on Azure Stack HCI.
- AKS provides integrated support for Azure services such as Azure Active Directory, Azure Monitor, and Azure Policy, while Azure Stack HCI AKS is designed to work with Azure Arc, which provides a unified management experience across on-premises, multi-cloud, and edge environments.
- AKS provides built-in security features such as network isolation, role-based access control, and private container registry, while Azure Stack HCI AKS requires additional configuration to implement these features.
- AKS provides automatic scaling of the Kubernetes cluster based on workload demands, while Azure Stack HCI AKS requires manual scaling.
- AKS provides a simplified billing model compared to running Kubernetes on your own infrastructure, as you only pay for the resources used by the AKS cluster. Azure Stack HCI AKS is included as part of the Azure Stack HCI subscription, which has a different billing model.

### What are capabilities that Azure Stack HCI aks does not provide compared with AKS itself?
- Azure Stack HCI AKS does not provide the same level of integration with Azure services as AKS, such as Azure Active Directory, Azure Monitor, and Azure Policy.
- **Active Directory**  -  For Azure Stack HCI AKS you will need to create nn Azure AD application and service principal, configuring the AKS cluster to use Azure AD for authentication, and granting the necessary permissions to the service principal.
- **Azure Monitor** - To use Azure Monitor with Azure Stack HCI, you can install the Azure Monitor agent on the HCI hosts and configure it to send data to Azure Monitor.
- **Azure Policy** - Azure Policy can be used to manage policies for Azure Stack HCI and AKS resources. For Azure Stack HCI, you can use Azure Policy to manage policies for virtual machines, storage accounts, and other resources that are part of your HCI cluster. For AKS, you can use Azure Policy to manage policies for Kubernetes resources, such as pods, services, and deployments. You can create custom policies or use built-in policies provided by Microsoft to enforce compliance with your organization's standards and best practices.

- Azure Stack HCI AKS may not have the same level of scalability as AKS, as it may be limited by the resources available on the on-premises infrastructure.
- **Adding/Removing Nodes** - Add or remove nodes from your HCI cluster using the Azure Stack HCI management tools or PowerShell cmdlets. When adding nodes, ensure that they meet the hardware and software requirements for your HCI cluster. Once the nodes are added or removed, configure the HCI cluster to use the new resources. You can do this using the HCI management tools or PowerShell cmdlets.
- **Scale out your HCI resources in case of a disaster or outage** - use Azure Site Recovery. Azure Site Recovery provides disaster recovery and business continuity solutions for your HCI cluster by replicating your HCI resources to another location.
- **Set up Recovery Services Vault and Configure Replication** - Begin by creating a Recovery Services Vault in Microsoft Azure, and then configure it to enable the replication of your Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI) resources to Azure. This establishes the foundation for the disaster recovery solution.
- **Install Azure Site Recovery Provider and Configuration** - Install the Azure Site Recovery Provider on the nodes of your HCI cluster. This provider facilitates the replication process. Configure these nodes to replicate the designated resources (such as virtual machines, applications, and data) to the previously set up Recovery Services Vault in Azure.
