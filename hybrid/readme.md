# Azure Hybrid Welcome Kit üåê

Welcome to the ultimate guide for Azure Stack HCI enthusiasts! Whether you are embarking on setting up a brand new cluster, developing an existing one, or looking to enhance your on-premises infrastructure, you have arrived at the right place. Understanding the complexity and the need for a reliable, flexible infrastructure, we have curated an extensive collection of resources specifically designed for Azure Stack HCI.  


## [1 - planning: Infrastructure Setup and Integration](./hci/1%20-%20planning/readme.md)
- There are a number of **requirements** to think about e.g. HW, Network, EntraID, ...
- **Hardware Sizing/Setup & Integration:** Optimal configuration and deployment of hardware resources for Azure Stack HCI, ensuring high-performance computing and operational efficiency ([Hardware Sizing Guide](https://aka.ms/FTAWelcomeKit/Hybrid/Sizing)).
- **Networking:** Strategic implementation of networking solutions to facilitate robust data communication and connectivity within Azure Stack HCI environments ([Networking Best Practices](./hci/1%20-%20planning/readme.md#network-topology)).
- **Storage:** Deployment of advanced storage solutions, tailored to manage data effectively in Azure Stack HCI, enhancing data availability and integrity ([Storage Configuration](./hci/1%20-%20planning/readme.md#storage)).

## [2 - deployment: Cluster Deployment Options & Creation ](./hci/2%20-%20deployment/readme.md)  
- **Cluster Creation and Registration:** Systematic establishment and registration of HCI clusters, focusing on scalability, manageability, and seamless integration ([Cluster Deployment Guidelines](https://aka.ms/FTAWelcomeKit/Hybrid/ClusterDeployment)).
- **Cluster Deployment (23H2)** Overview of the steps of the deployment from installing of the OS to The actual cluster deployment([Cluster Deployment (23H2)](./hci/2%20-%20deployment/readme.md)).

## [3 - governance: Management](./hci/3%20-%20governance/readme.md)
- **Monitoring:** Implementation of comprehensive monitoring solutions for Azure Stack HCI, enabling real-time oversight and proactive management of system health ([Monitoring Solutions](./hci/3%20-%20governance/ClusterMonitoring.md)).
- **Management:** Advanced management practices for Azure Stack HCI, focusing on operational efficiency, resource optimization, and continuous system improvement ([Management Best Practices](./hci/3%20-%20governance/ClusterManagement.md)).
- **Hybrid Security:** Establishment of robust security frameworks, ensuring comprehensive protection of data and applications in hybrid cloud and on-premises environments ([Hybrid Security Protocols](./hci/3%20-%20governance/Security.md)).

## [4 - scenarios: Services and Applications](./hci/4%20-%20scenarios/readme.md)  
- **Migrations:** Strategic planning and execution of workload migrations to Azure Stack HCI, ensuring minimal disruption and optimal resource utilization ([Migration Strategies](./hci/4%20-%20scenarios/migration/readme.md)).
