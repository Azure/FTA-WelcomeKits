Brainstorming:
- Add-server scenario (e.g. after a rebuild)
- Do a cluster update
- Do a 23H2 proxy deployment
- Deploy a 23H2 cluster using an ARM template
- Do a cluster upgrade (22H2 -> 23H2)
- How to Bitlocker recovery (key) required due to Update (driver/FW) in HW that does prevent all nodes to reboot.(need to enable bitlocker recovery key tools RSAT -> Features to view them on AD )
