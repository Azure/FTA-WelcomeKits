# Welcome Kit - Azure Stack HCI - Stretch Cluster Deployment

>**Note**: As of now (date 03-June-2024) stretched clustering is not (yet) available in 23H2. This is supposed to be a future feature ("*...Development will take some time: we expect to share more details around mid-year...*"). If stretched clustering is required then deploying 22H2 is the only option.  
> See [Cosmos D's][cosmos23H2] blog post for more info.
