Welcome to the ultimate guide for Azure VMware Solution enthusiasts! Whether you are embarking on setting up a brand new software defined data center or expanding an existing one, you have arrived at the right place. Understanding the complexity and the need for a reliable, flexible infrastructure, we have curated an extensive collection of resources specifically designed for Azure VMware Solution.

This Welcome Kit is structured into the following categories (or phases):

[Architecture \& Design](#architecture--design)  
[Plan](#plan)  
[Prepare](#prepare)  
[Deploy](#deploy)  
[Migrate](#migrate)  
[Govern](#govern)  
[Secure](#secure)  

## Architecture & Design

In these sections ([**design**](architectureAndDesign/design) and [**architecture**](architectureAndDesign/architecture)) we will explain the core architectural concepts for Azure VMware Solution deployments. It addresses the core concepts for Azure VMware Solution Software Defined Data Centers (SDDC) and the various services in Azure that are critical to understand Azure VMware Solution.

## Plan

In this [section](plan/plan) we will explain the fundamental concepts that are relevant to all planning session when considering an Azure VMware Solution [deployment](deploy/deploy)

## Prepare  

In this [section](prepare/prepare) we will explain the fundamental concepts that are relevant to to preparing to [deploy](deploy/deploy) an Azure VMware Solution implementation.

## Deploy  

In this [section](deploy/deploy) we will explain the options available to and highlight some key focus areas when you are ready to start deploying your Azure VMware Solution. Please do **NOT** skip here directly. [**Design**](architectureAndDesign/design), [**Architecture**](architectureAndDesign/architecture), [**Plan**](plan/plan) and [**Prepare**](prepare/prepare) are key aspects to ensure success.

## Migrate  

In this [section](migrate/migrate) we will explain the concepts related to the assessment of your Azure VMware Solution environment and we will explain different migration tools available to you.

## Govern  

In this [section](govern/govern) we will cover key aspects that should be included in all areas of your deployment, these include Governance, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery.

## Secure  

In this [section](secure/secure) we will cover key aspects that should be included in all _**security related**_ areas of your deployment, these include security considerations and baselines that are applicable to Azure VMware Solution.
